## Basic Configuration Options

TabMon utilizes two main application config files, located in the “Config” directory in the TabMon install location:

-   **TabMon.config** – Governs which machines will be monitored, how results will be written, and how often that performance will be sampled.

-   **Counters.config** – Specifies the set of performance counters that will be monitored.

## Tabmon.config 

Go to the install directory and modify the `TabMon.config` file as necessary. (Located in `\Program Files (x86)\TabMon\Config\TabMon.config`)

The default `TabMon.config` file looks like the following:

By default, this configuration will poll the performance counters on localhost every 60 seconds and write out the results to the specified database.

**NOTE:** If you changed your database parameters during setup, you will need to update them here.


## Counters.config 

The default Counters.config file comes with a good starter set of counters for monitoring Tableau Server 9.3 and 10.0. If you are using TabMon to monitor an older version of Tableau, you will need to overwrite this with the `Counters.config` file specific to your version, these are kept in the `Resources\Configurations` folder in the TabMon install directory. Note that if you switch your `Counters.config` file in this way, you should also switch to the appropriate version of the Sample Workbook (found in `\Resources\Sample Workbooks`).

Feel free to add or remove counters from `Counters.config` to suit your monitoring needs!


## Advanced Configuration Options

There are a few optional advanced options you can configure TabMon with:

### Export to CSV

- To export to CSV file, replace “db” with “csv” in the line `<OutputMode value=”db”/>`. This causes counter data to be stored in a CSV file in a folder called “Results” in the main TabMon directory.

### Remote Polling Setup

To poll data from a machine/machines other than your local host:

1. Add a new `<Host name=””>` entry, with the name set to the network name or IP address of the target machine. You can nest multiple hosts within a “Cluster” element to logically group them.

2.  Ensure that the “Remote Registry” and “Performance Logs & Alerts” Windows services are running and set to Start Mode: Automatic on all remote machines.

3.  On the TabMon machine, go to Services and right click and select properties for “TabMon”. Make sure that the account for logon has privileges on the machine you would like to remotely connect to. Specifically, the service account must:

    i.  On each server you wish to remotely monitor: have admin permissions or be a member of the "Performance Monitor Users" and "Performance Log Users" domain group

    ii.  On the machine where TabMon is installed: have permissions to run as a service and write to the TabMon install directory.

### Set a Data Retention Threshold

TabMon generates a lot of data, especially when using an aggressive polling rate. To help manage this, when using TabMon to output to database, you can set a data retention threshold so that old data is automatically dropped.

To set this, open up `TabMon.config` and find the following line:

`<PurgeOldData enabled="false" thresholdDays="30"/>`

Change the `enabled` attribute from **false** to **true** and set the `thresholdDays` attribute to the number of days beyond which you want data to be dropped. These changes will take effect on restart.
