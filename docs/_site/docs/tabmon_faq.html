<h3 id="1--how-to-i-connect-to-the-tabmon-workbook">1.  How to I connect to the TabMon workbook?</h3>

<p>The TabMon workbook is included in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Resources\Sample Workbooks</code> folder in the TabMon install directory. Note that you should make sure to use the version of the Sample Workbook that matches the Tableau Server version. The SampleWorkbook is meant to fit on top of the schema set in the Counters.config file, so make sure you are using the correct Counters.config file for your version as well!</p>

<p>To connect the workbook to your own server, open the workbook and enter the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Your read-only password for the data source: Server Auditing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your postgres DB name and password for you locally installed or remotely installed database (for the data source: TabMon)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="2--what-do-all-these-counters-represent">2.  What do all these counters represent?</h3>

<p>The counters collected by the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">Counters.config</code> file represent a common set of performance metrics that would be of interest to an average server admin. Information on the Perfmon counters can be found at Microsoft’s Perfmon counter reference at <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc768048.aspx" target="_blank"><em>https://technet.microsoft.com/enus/library/cc768048.aspx</em>.</a></p>

<h3 id="3--my-processor-time-is-over-100-how-is-this-possible">3.  My “%Processor Time” is over 100%; how is this possible?</h3>

<p>TabMon uses the Windows Perfmon counter “Process\% Processor Time” to calculate the amount of CPU used by individual processes. By the nature of this counter, for a single CPU (single core) the maximum value is 100%. For a multi-core system, the maximum percentage is #cores * 100% (for example a 4 core system will have a max of 400%).</p>

<h3 id="4--the-tabmon-service-wont-start">4.  The TabMon service won’t start.</h3>

<p>If TabMon is failing to start, it is likely due to a permissions issue. The most common cause of this is that the user trying to start TabMon does not have admin privileges, or else the account the TabMon service is running as does not have sufficient permissions. Remember that if you are using Remote Polling, then TabMon must be running as a user with appropriate permissions on all of the remote machines.</p>

<p>If you’ve double-checked all relevant permissions and TabMon still isn’t starting, a good way to get a clue is to check the most recent event from the application logs – see <code class="highlighter-rouge">C:\Program Files (x86)\TabMon\Logs\</code>.</p>

<h3 id="5--im-seeing-tons-of-counter-polling-failures">5.  I’m seeing tons of counter polling failures!</h3>

<p>Make sure you are using the proper <code class="highlighter-rouge">Counters.config</code> file for the version of Tableau Server that you are monitoring. See the <a href="tabmon_configure">Configuring TabMon</a> section for more information on this. If you’re using the proper Counters.config file and still several failures, checking the logs can provide insight.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that systems can be very different and the machine(s) you are monitoring may simply not have certain counters.</p>

<h3 id="6--tabmon-is-dropping-jmx-counters-after-i-restart-tableau-server">6.  TabMon is dropping JMX counters after I restart Tableau Server.</h3>

<p>This is normal. Restarting the server will cycle the open JMX ports and you will experience a temporary loss in connectivity for JMX counters. TabMon includes reconnection logic which will eventually automatically re-establish all of the connections.</p>

<h3 id="7--help-tabmon-is-generating-way-too-much-data">7.  Help! TabMon is generating way too much data!</h3>

<p>By default, TabMon samples all performance counters every minute and keeps that data around forever. Over the long term, this can amount to a lot of data!</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to address this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you are using TabMon to write to a database, you can set a data retention threshold so that old/expired data is automatically dropped. See <a href="tabmon_configure#set-a-data-retention-threshold">Set a Data Retention Threshold</a> for details on how to do this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can set the poll interval to a lower frequency so that less data is generated. You can do this by updating <code class="highlighter-rouge">PollInterval</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">TabMon.config</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can update <code class="highlighter-rouge">Counters.config</code> to remove performance counters that you don’t care about, in order to reduce data volume.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="8--what-processesservices-does-tabmon-monitor">8.  What Processes/Services does TabMon monitor?</h3>

<p>TabMon tracks all Tableau Server related processes below (taken from <a href="http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/processes.htm" target="_blank"><em>http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/processes.htm</em>)</a>:</p>

Memory consumption is primarily based on the size of the data extracts being loaded. The 64-bit binary is used as the default on 64-bit operating systems, even if 32-bit Tableau Server is installed. The data engine is multi-threaded to handle multiple requests at a time. Under high load it can consume CPU, I/O, and network resources, all of which can be a performance bottleneck under load. At high load, a single instance of the data engine can consume all CPU resources to process requests.</td>

<h3 id="9--how-do-i-determine-if-i-have-system-bottlenecks-on-my-server-instance">9.  How do I determine if I have system bottlenecks on my Server Instance?</h3>

<p>Microsoft has some general guidelines for server health available in help documents and online articles.</p>

<p>Refer to: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.08.pulse.aspx" target="_blank"><em>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.08.pulse.aspx</em> </a></p>

<p>In general, here are some common bottlenecks/general guidelines <strong>(this list is neither authoritative nor is it a definitive guide to the server health; actual results will vary)</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Free Disk Space: Keep above 15% for critical systems</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Memory (RAM): Keep under 80% for extended periods of time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Processor %: Keep under 85% for extended periods of time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Network: Keep under 70% of the interface’s throughput (depending on network card)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="10--what-are-cache-hitsmisses">10.  What are cache hits/misses?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A Cache hit is a successful lookup in a cache server.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Cache miss is an unsuccessful lookup in a cache server</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally speaking, an effective cache server has more hits than misses (aka a high Cache Hit Ratio)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="11--what-is-request-latency-and-what-does-it-mean-for-me">11.  What is Request Latency and what does it mean for me?</h3>

<p>Request Latency is the time it takes for the host server to receive and process a request. Latency can be reduced by tweaking and upgrading computer hardware.</p>

<h3 id="12--can-i-use-tabmon-to-monitor-hosts-that-arent-running-tableau">12.  Can I use TabMon to monitor hosts that aren’t running Tableau?</h3>

<p>Absolutely! Just edit your Counters.config file to remove all of the MBean counters as well as the PerfMon counters that specifically relate to Tableau processes.</p>

<h3 id="13--where-can-i-get-additional-supportfeedback">13.  Where can I get additional support/feedback?</h3>
