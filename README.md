## What is TabMon?

TabMon is a performance monitoring agent that periodically samples target hosts for a set of Perfmon and MBean counters and writes out the results to a database in a Tableau-friendly format.  This information can then be used to monitor & analyze performance of a Tableau Server installation, in order to detect potential issues or assess scalability & sizing.

TabMon can be run as both a console app and a Windows service.
